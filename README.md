Game Shop PH


Process:

1. Create a fork of this repository by clicking Fork, found in the upper right section of the page. This will create a copy of the GameShop repository (original repository) to your own GitHub account and will serve as your personal "online" copy of the project. Any changes made to your Fork will not affect the original repository.

2. In your local repository (VS), add both the original repository and your forked repository.

3. When making a change, create a branch to keep track of the change we are making (Branches are kind of shelvesets in TFS).

4. Let's follow this guide. :) https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
